# How are we going about it?

- MERN stack that has the most amount of traction in the market so easier to find developers.
- Building a clean modular design with RESTFul APIs that control all communication between modules
- Modular part will allow for remote collaboration by experts
- Also the APIs structure will allow building automated test case buildout that will improve testing as we grow larger
- Building a superstructure for the data tables and using a relational database for structured data (MySQL) and an unstructured DB for rapid access and build for data (Mongo)
-
