# Why ?

- The current version of Leaderjam is a good MVP.
- In the GTM stage there is a lot of quick pivoting that is needed.
- Need a lite agile codebase to support the product evolution
- There are a lot of scaling issues and bloated code that is causing the MVP to slow down.
- Also the current version is built in PHP and is a hassle finding good developers.
- Also the current system is built by a third party and we do not have control over the site and its performance.
